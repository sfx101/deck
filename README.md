# Docker Stacks
Docker Stacks is a laradock GUI build on top of docker, electron.js, node-pty, xterm.js and the awesome laradock

### Why a GUI?

- Starting, stopping, re-building is pretty painful in Laradock when you're working on a number of projects
- Setting up more than one project requires a bit of expert knowledge in Laradock, especially when someone is getting started, the desktop app solves this problem by using random open ports without editing any server config
- Takes away the learning curve on knowing Laradock / Docker commands so that things can be done at the click of a button
- Developers who still rely on XAMPP / WAMP gets a look how powerful Docker is as a development environment
- Supports pre-build images for running Laravel or any PHP frameworks, Wordpress or any CMS in few mins
